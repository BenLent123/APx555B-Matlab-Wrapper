# APx555B-Matlab-Wrapper
Basic Matlab scripts and a Matlab obj wrapper for the APX555B to handle FFT measurements and return the PSD for a BEP project

# Script handles
  - Input termination
  - FFTlength
  - Windowtype
  - Export settings
  - Scope/FFT/PSD
  - Power Average Amount
------------------------------------
    
Certain features, such as non-power averaging, multichannel support, Output support, Sample methods, sampling rate/bandwidth, and other customizable settings, are left untouched since they are not required for my specific case.

- To learn more, use the official APx programming guide + APx has an API documentation which helps!
